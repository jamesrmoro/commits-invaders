# 🎮 Commit Invaders – A Game Made with Amazon Q CLI

This project was created as part of the **Amazon Q CLI Game Challenge**. The idea was simple: use the [Amazon Q CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) to help generate a game concept and bring it to life — and that’s exactly what this is!

## 🧠 About the Game

**Commit Invaders** is a retro-inspired web game where your mission is to destroy GitHub commits falling from above.  
It’s built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, with real GitHub contribution data fetched from any username you input!

## 🚀 How It Was Made

- Brainstorming and structure powered by **Amazon Q CLI**
- Developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Visuals inspired by **Space Invaders**
- Real data from the GitHub API
- Hosted on **Vercel**

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Enter any GitHub username.
2. Shoot the commits before they reach your ship!
3. Watch out — the green ones are more active contributors 😉
